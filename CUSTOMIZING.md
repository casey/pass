Customizing rust-boilerplate for a new project:

- [ ] Fork and rename repository
- [ ] Change `Cargo.toml` to reflect the details of your project
- [ ] If your project is a library, delete `Cargo.lock` and add it to `.gitignore`
- [ ] Add or remove rules from rustfmt.toml 
- [ ] Log in to https://travis-ci.org and add your repository
- [ ] Log in to https://nightli.es/ and enable nightly builds
